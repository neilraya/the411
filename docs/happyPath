The "happy path" is as follows:

1.A user navigates to our website, where they are prompted to sign in using twitter 
2.The user signs in using twitter login, and upon correctly entering their username and password, are successfully redirected back to the "welcome back" page of our website
3.The user is now logged in and can access the features specific to their account on our web app

Some things that could go wrong:
1.The user incorrectly enters their login information

2.The user does not have an active Twitter account
