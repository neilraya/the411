Web Application Name: P&P

Description:

Story 1:
The purpose of this web application is to assist users/people with finding destinations in their given location. 
The list of destinations will be ranked based on price, transportation, and weather. When the user opens up the web application,
a list of destinations will appear. This web application will be using an optional login feature. Users will be able to
login and create accounts to have a profile and history of past destinations. Initially, users will not have to create an
account to interact with the main interface of the website. The user will be able to scroll through destinations feed.

Story 2:
As a logged in user, I search for a location. I see the weather at that location 
and a list of activities that are sorted dependent on the weather at the location. Next to the activities 
there is a button to save an activity for later or make a reservation.

Story 3:
As a logged in user traveling to New York with a group of friends, I can access my 
favorite places and activities from my previous trip. Instead of searching for new 
places, I clicked on my favorites list. I filtered out the New York events from the 
database to show my friends event details such as pricing and reviews. 

Story 4:
As a first time user, I want to be able to create an account. I want to be able to sign in to that account with a third-party
login, so that I can start using the app to plan my travel activities in each city that I visit. If I enter the wrong
password, I want to be prompted with a message telling me that the password I have entered is invalid.
