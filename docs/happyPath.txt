The "happy path" is as follows:

1.A user navigates to our website, where they are prompted to sign in using twitter 
2.The user clicks on "sign in using Twitter" and correctly enters their username and password, and then presses submit
3.The user is successfully redirected back to the "welcome back" page of our website
4.The user is now logged in and can access the features specific to their account on our web app

Some things that could go wrong:
1.The user incorrectly enters their login information
2.The user does not have an active Twitter account
